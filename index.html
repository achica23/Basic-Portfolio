      <p>Hello! I was born and raised in Rutland, VT for 20+ years. I graduated High School in 2012 and went to
        Community College of Vermont for 1 year. I then went to University of Southern Maine for 1.5 years.</p>

      <p>When I was going to visit one of my friends I was sitting on my flight and the girl next to me started talking
        to me about a National Service Program called AmeriCorps FEMA Corps. We chatted the whole flight and when I went
        back home a few days later I decided to apply!</p>

      <p>I was accepted and started 10 months of service in July 2015, when I completed my term of service with over
        1,500 hours I applied for FEMA. I got a reservist job with them and started working that same year in July.</p>

      <p>3 years later and I have worked at 4 different disasters in 3 states, I live in Florida, I am married to
        someone I met thanks to my job, and we have a 3 year old Cane Corso, Buddha, and a 4 month old Son named
        William! </p>
